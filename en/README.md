# PXVIRT 

![](../img/logo.png#pic_center)

PXVIRT is a variant of Proxmox VE, developed and maintained by [Lierfang](https://www.lierfang.com).

This documentation primarily introduces the differences between PXVIRT and PVE, as well as how to use PXVIRT features.

PVE management consists of 3 parts:

1. UI interface
2. Backend
3. API interface

Our main focus is on backend development and enriching the API interfaces, making it easier for developers to use PXVIRT features.
